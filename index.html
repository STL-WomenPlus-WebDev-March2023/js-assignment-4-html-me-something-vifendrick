      <h1>A Comparison of Willys Wonderland and Five Nights at Freddys</h1>
      <h2>Because who is Parsons kidding</h2>

     <p> In 2016 G.O. Parsons crafts the idea of Wally’s Wonderland: a four minute short about A janitor going to work at an abandoned chuck-e-cheese like pizza place that is occupied solely by a robotic bear. Originally this was meant to be a full length film, but due to lack of funding, Parsons settled for a short film. </p>
     <p>The years passed and Parsons was unsatisfied. He re-pitched the idea, and by a stroke of luck- Nicolas Cage joined the crew both as a producer and the lead actor, the Janitor. Thus, Willy’s Wonderland was born. Similarly to the short film, Willy’s Wonderland follows the story of a traveler (the janitor) who winds up stranded in a small town. Due to circumstances, he finds himself clean old, abandoned Willy’s Wonderland while his vehicle is getting fixed. During this adventure he cleans, plays pinball, and kicks some animatronic ass. </p>

      <p>Now you're thinking, why not just make this page about Willy’s Wonderland and why in god’s name Nick Cage is in a low budget film and has no lines? Well, dear reader. I have a conspiracy.</p>

     <p>When Willy’s Wonderland came out in 2021, it gained a cult following due to its similarities to Five Nights at Freddys (2014). Parsons and the director Kevin Lewis claim that there is no correlation whatsoever. Parson said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, that his inspiration was actually a place called Boomtown right outside of Reno, NV. I did some digging; I cannot find ANY information of Boomtown having any past with animatronics despite what Parsons explained. </p>
