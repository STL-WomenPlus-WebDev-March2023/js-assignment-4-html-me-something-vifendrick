            <p> In 2016 G.O. Parsons crafts the idea of Wally’s Wonderland: a four minute short about A janitor going to work at an abandoned chuck-e-cheese like pizza place that is occupied solely by a robotic bear. Originally this was meant to be a full length film, but due to lack of funding, Parsons settled for a short film. </p>
            <p>The years passed and Parsons was unsatisfied. He re-pitched the idea, and by a stroke of luck- Nicolas Cage joined the crew both as a producer and the lead actor, the Janitor. Thus, Willy’s Wonderland was born. Similarly to the short film, Willy’s Wonderland follows the story of a traveler (the janitor) who winds up stranded in a small town. Due to circumstances, he finds himself clean old, abandoned Willy’s Wonderland while his vehicle is getting fixed. During this adventure he cleans, plays pinball, and kicks some animatronic ass. </p>
            <p class="point">Now you're thinking, why not just make this page about Willy’s Wonderland and why in god’s name Nick Cage is in a low budget film and has no lines? Well, dear reader. I have a conspiracy.</p>
            <p>When Willy’s Wonderland came out in 2021, it gained a cult following due to its similarities to Five Nights at Freddys (2014). Parsons and the director Kevin Lewis claim that there is no correlation whatsoever. Parson said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, that his inspiration was actually a place called Boomtown right outside of Reno, NV. I did some digging; I cannot find ANY information of Boomtown having any past with animatronics despite what Parsons explained. </p>

            <h3>Willy’s Wonderland</h3>
            <p>As mentioned, Willy's was once owned by Jerry Robert Willis, a deranged serial killer, who would dress up as Willy and kill families within the Super Happy Fun Room in cold blood, alongside the other serial killers who he teamed up with. However, Jerry and his crew had performed a satanic suicide ritual and transferred their souls into the animatronics to avoid being arrested. Following this incident, Willy's Wonderland was closed down. Ten years later, Willy's was reopened with a new owner, Tex Macadoo, whom tries to keep the public unaware of the restaurant's past.</p>
            <p>However, the killers continued to attack people as the animatronics, and even started attacking people outside of the establishment. After several, missing person reports, Willy's was closed down once again. However, Tex did not bulldoze it since, as the teenagers put it, Willy got to him. Eventually, Tex, sheriff Eloise Lund, and Jet Love made a deal with the animatronics that they would feed them if they left the townspeople alone.</p>

            <h3>Five Nights at Freddys</h3>
            <p>In the game, the player takes control of a night shift security guard at a derelict pizzeria known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, which is rumored to contain haunted and reanimated life-size animatronics that wander the facility at night.</p>
            <p>Look, the lore is deep and complicated. What you need to know is that a child was killed outside the establishment and it led to an investigation. The killer eventually comes back to continue a killing spree. Each of the five kids killed is stuffed into an animatronic. The animatronics in turn are programmed to kill the murderer, but technology isn’t perfect and they see each security guards as the murderers hence the long game franchise. </p>

            <h3>Five Nights at Freddys</h3>
            <p>Five Nights at Freddys cast is Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy(there are so many more but I am focusing on these base game ones).</p>
            <p class="point">What’s that? They’re all different… right? WRONG. See they’re different now, but Parsons original plan was to have the cast of characters be: Douglas Dog, Pauly Penguin, Beary Bear, Pirate Pete, and Regina Rabbit…. I think this speaks for itself. The reason for the change is accredited to Nick Cage evidently loving reptiles and amphibians. He pitched the change (I don’t know if I believe this).</p>

         <div class="text">
            <p>Honestly, Parsons was probably just trying to avoid a lawsuit. I love both franchises regardless. Willy’s Wonderland paved the way to have a Five Nights at Freddys movie. Do I wish that it was just branded that way? Sure! But I don’t think we were ready for one yet. I also believe that this film influenced the creation of Mongomery Gator in the newer Five Nights at Freddys game. I feel like the creators were poking fun at Parsons’ denial of inspiration.</p>
            <P>I highly recommend watching Willy’s Wonderland! It’s an awful movie, and Nicolas Cage literally doesn’t say a thing, but it holds a special place in my heart.</p>
